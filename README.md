## Welcome to my blog!

My name is Camille Hall majoring in Web Design and Development. I just love the world of technologies, it excites me for an odd reason. I love the Korean and Japanese culture but most of the time I listen to Korean music. A day doesn't pass by without me listening to Korean pop songs. 

### Learning 

Designing is fun but coding makes it even better. I'm looking forward to learning more about this field because technologies is increasing and becoming smarter.
