## Welcome to my blog!
# Blog 1
My name is Camille Hall majoring in Web Design and Development. I have two older brothers and they are back home in the Philippines. I also have two nephews.  I love Korean and Japanese culture but most of the time I listen to Korean music. A day doesn't pass by without me listening to Korean pop songs. I just love the world of technologies, it excites me for an odd reason.

### Learning 

Designing is fun but coding makes it even better. My only experience with JavaScript was from a past class I've taken. And all I can say it's so interesting and unbelievable how smart it is. I'm still in the progress of my coding skills and is willing to go deeper about JavaScript I'm looking forward to learning more about this field because technologies are increasing and becoming smarter.
